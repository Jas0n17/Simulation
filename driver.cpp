 * This program runs a algorithum between two objects (pizza stores) within a week interval. Both objects have different variables, advantages, and disadvantages. The randomization of consuming and baking pizzas are the same though the rate of their baking are different. This algorithum displays a visual that allows user to keep track of the amount of pizza and the winners. Program also generates a file "log.txt" that record the results of each day
